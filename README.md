# PLP-Final-Project
This is the final project for the PLP cohort 1 scholarship program. It is a web based project which aims at enabling restaurants/chefs  sale  their services,recipies and their different delicacies online. Users have the ability to make orders, for both meals and services, and also purchase the recipies for coooking the different meals. It also has an Admin section for monitoring the website(orders and users). This program is just but a prototype and not fully functional. Though i've made sure to demonstrate atleast every functionality in the program. I have used HTML and CSS  for the front-end development,PHP and SQL for the back-end part of it and the daraja API STK push for the payment intergration.
N/B:  For best experience run the code with internet connection.
